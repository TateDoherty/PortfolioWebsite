								<p class="tatefontarial" style="font-family: Arial;">		Growing up, my parents pursued quite different job trajectories. My mother is a talented
									professional artist while my father works as a mechanical engineer. My mother taught me to be
									more creative and to use my imagination to solve solutions whereas my father insisted on using
									mathematics and practicality. Through these distinct perspectives, I have incorporated the
									creativity and rationality that is presented when dealing with data in order to prepare myself for a
									position as a data analyst.
									I am eager to keep looking for innovative methods to display my love of numbers and data to
									identify new potential opportunities for growth and support organizations through effective data
									analysis. Several qualities to display my abilities are listed below:
									
									<ul class="tatefontarial" style="font-family: Arial;">
										<li>Data Analysis: Being a podcast editor requires obtaining, analyzing, and evaluating
											data on views, subscriber count, and interactions in order to develop original podcast
											ideas and produce daily material. By creating daily content and offering effective input
											and feedback, I have increased the overall number of subscribers on my company's
											YouTube channel by 300 and the number of views to 50,000 in a year.
										</li>
									</ul> 
									
									<ul class="tatefontarial" style="font-family: Arial;">
										<li>
											Technical Skills: As an Autonomous Aerospace Intern at Northrop Grumman, I
											participated in 10 technical meetings and presentations and developed technical skills in
											programming languages such as HTML and Python. My education in MIS at SDSU has
											further enhanced my technical skills in CSS, SQL, and Statistics through courses such
											as Web Development, Statistics, Data Management Systems, Object Oriented
											Programming, etc.
										</li>
									</ul>
									
									<ul class="tatefontarial" style="font-family: Arial;">
										<li>
											Organization Skills: As a Supervisor at High Country West Club, I was in charge of
											archiving over 5,000 appointments for visitors, which required careful attention to detail
											and adept data analytic skills to assure correctness and effectiveness. I also oversaw
											the pool's daily operations, such as upkeep, cleaning, and customer relations.
											
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p class="tatefontarial" style="font-family: Arial;">
										I appreciate your time to consider my application for the Data Analyst position. I am excited
										about the chance to discuss my qualifications with you in an interview. Please contact me by
										phone number or email if you have any further questions.
										<br>
										<br>Sincerely,
										<br>Tate Doherty
